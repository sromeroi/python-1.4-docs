# python-1.4-docs - Released in 1996

Python 1.4 documentation, downloaded from https://docs.python.org/release/1.4/ and prepared for offline use.

Added some old missing icons and fixed some links so that you can browse back to the Top index.

I started to learn Python with Python 1.4 and a couple or decades later I missed the source code and the documentation easily available.
