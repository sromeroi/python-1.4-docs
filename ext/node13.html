<P>
In languages like C or C++, the programmer is responsible for
dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory on the heap.  In C, this
is done using the functions <CODE>malloc()</CODE> and <CODE>free()</CODE>.  In
C++, the operators <CODE>new</CODE> and <CODE>delete</CODE> are used with
essentially the same meaning; they are actually implemented using
<CODE>malloc()</CODE> and <CODE>free()</CODE>, so we'll restrict the following
discussion to the latter.
<P>
Every block of memory allocated with <CODE>malloc()</CODE> should eventually
be returned to the pool of available memory by exactly one call to
<CODE>free()</CODE>.  It is important to call <CODE>free()</CODE> at the right
time.  If a block's address is forgotten but <CODE>free()</CODE> is not
called for it, the memory it occupies cannot be reused until the
program terminates.  This is called a <I><DFN>memory leak</DFN></I>.  On the other
hand, if a program calls <CODE>free()</CODE> for a block and then continues
to use the block, it creates a conflict with re-use of the block
through another <CODE>malloc()</CODE> call.  This is called <I><DFN>using freed
memory</DFN></I> has the same bad consequences as referencing uninitialized
data -- core dumps, wrong results, mysterious crashes.
<P>
Common causes of memory leaks are unusual paths through the code.  For
instance, a function may allocate a block of memory, do some
calculation, and then free the block again.  Now a change in the
requirements for the function may add a test to the calculation that
detects an error condition and can return prematurely from the
function.  It's easy to forget to free the allocated memory block when
taking this premature exit, especially when it is added later to the
code.  Such leaks, once introduced, often go undetected for a long
time: the error exit is taken only in a small fraction of all calls,
and most modern machines have plenty of virtual memory, so the leak
only becomes apparent in a long-running process that uses the leaking
function frequently.  Therefore, it's important to prevent leaks from
happening by having a coding convention or strategy that minimizes
this kind of errors.
<P>
Since Python makes heavy use of <CODE>malloc()</CODE> and <CODE>free()</CODE>, it
needs a strategy to avoid memory leaks as well as the use of freed
memory.  The chosen method is called <I><DFN>reference counting</DFN></I>.  The
principle is simple: every object contains a counter, which is
incremented when a reference to the object is stored somewhere, and
which is decremented when a reference to it is deleted.  When the
counter reaches zero, the last reference to the object has been
deleted and the object is freed.
<P>
An alternative strategy is called <I><DFN>automatic garbage collection</DFN></I>.
(Sometimes, reference counting is also referred to as a garbage
collection strategy, hence my use of ``automatic'' to distinguish the
two.)  The big advantage of automatic garbage collection is that the
user doesn't need to call <CODE>free()</CODE> explicitly.  (Another claimed
advantage is an improvement in speed or memory usage -- this is no
hard fact however.)  The disadvantage is that for C, there is no
truly portable automatic garbage collector, while reference counting
can be implemented portably (as long as the functions <CODE>malloc()</CODE>
and <CODE>free()</CODE> are available -- which the C Standard guarantees).
Maybe some day a sufficiently portable automatic garbage collector
will be available for C.  Until then, we'll have to live with
reference counts.
