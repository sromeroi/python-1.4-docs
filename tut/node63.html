<P>
Python supports a limited form of multiple inheritance as well.  A
class definition with multiple base classes looks as follows:
<P>
<PRE>        class DerivedClassName(Base1, Base2, Base3):
                &lt;statement-1&gt;
                .
                .
                .
                &lt;statement-N&gt;</PRE>
<P>
The only rule necessary to explain the semantics is the resolution
rule used for class attribute references.  This is depth-first,
left-to-right.  Thus, if an attribute is not found in
<code>DerivedClassName</code>, it is searched in <code>Base1</code>, then
(recursively) in the base classes of <code>Base1</code>, and only if it is
not found there, it is searched in <code>Base2</code>, and so on.
<P>
(To some people breadth first--searching <code>Base2</code> and
<code>Base3</code> before the base classes of <code>Base1</code>--looks more
natural.  However, this would require you to know whether a particular
attribute of <code>Base1</code> is actually defined in <code>Base1</code> or in
one of its base classes before you can figure out the consequences of
a name conflict with an attribute of <code>Base2</code>.  The depth-first
rule makes no differences between direct and inherited attributes of
<code>Base1</code>.)
<P>
It is clear that indiscriminate use of multiple inheritance is a
maintenance nightmare, given the reliance in Python on conventions to
avoid accidental name conflicts.  A well-known problem with multiple
inheritance is a class derived from two classes that happen to have a
common base class.  While it is easy enough to figure out what happens
in this case (the instance will have a single copy of ``instance
variables'' or data attributes used by the common base class), it is
not clear that these semantics are in any way useful.
