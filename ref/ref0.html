<P>Abstract
</B>
</center>
<P><EM>Python is a simple, yet powerful, interpreted programming
language that bridges the gap between C and shell programming, and is
thus ideally suited for "throw-away programming" and rapid
prototyping. Its syntax is put together from constructs borrowed from
a variety of other languages; most prominent are influences from ABC,
C, Modula-3 and Icon.</EM>

<P><EM>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions
and data types implemented in C. Python is also suitable as an
extension language for highly customizable C applications such as
editors or window managers.</EM>

<P><EM>Python is available for various systems, amongst which most
common flavors of UNIX (including Linux), the Apple Macintosh, MS-DOS,
MS-Windows 3.1(1), Windows 95, Windows NT, and OS/2.</EM>

<P><EM>This reference manual describes the syntax and "core semantics"
of the language. It is terse, but attempts to be exact and
complete. The semantics of non-essential built-in object types and of
the built-in functions and modules are described in the <I>Python
Library Reference</I>. For an informal introduction to the language,
see the <I>Python Tutorial</I>.</EM>
